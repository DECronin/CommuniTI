## Concept:
A pseudo-anonymous Forum-Style online community to promote healthy constructive communication by challenging contributors to site relevant sources. By substituting personal bias and uneducated opinions with knowledgeable and documented information, users can explore both sides of an argument yet are encouraged to utilize a healthy approach to debate societal issues.

## User Stories:
- As a User, I need to be able to navigate clearly throughout the site, such as from a list of threads related to a specific topic then further into its comments.
- As a User, I want to Log In or Sign Up to submit Forms for Comments, Threads, Topics and Resources.
- As a Logged In User, I want to Navigate through the site and my status persist until a preset TimeOut or I choose to Log Out.

## Motivation:
I, as well as the majority of this generation, have at one time or another been influenced by biased or aggressive views on from “Unreliable Narrators” without evidence or reliable knowledge for support. Too often, this unreliable information results in making uninformed and imprudent, even arrogant, decisions. I envision a society and future generation making wiser, more intelligent decisions through promoting an unbiased knowledgeable forum that challenges the “Unreliable Narrator” to utilize evidenced documentation and reliable sources. My goal is to develop a forum that (with some help from levels of administration) brings attention to and weeds out the spread of aggressive, biased, and irrelevant marketing or gossip by maintaining a higher standard with which our future generation will learn to utilize and critique resources to make informed decisions. 
Communication Trumps Ignorance.
